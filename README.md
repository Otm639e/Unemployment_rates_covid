# Unemployment_rates_covid
A UC Berkeley Project done for For Data 100 Fall 2021

Seeing Covid-19 data and its correlation with Unemployment rates throughout counties in the U.S.

The model used was a linear regression model. This was an appropriate model to use because we want to use continuous quantitative variables: case numbers and masking rates, to predict a continuous quantitative variable: the amount of unemployed people in a county. The inputs to the model are case numbers and masking rates in each county, while the output is the amount of unemployed people in a given county.

The result can be seen in the Jupyter Notebook!!
